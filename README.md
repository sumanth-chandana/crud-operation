# CRUD-operation
**CRUD Operations** using HTML, CSS and JavaScript
- There is an array of objects where data is present in the form of table( written dynamically in **JS**).
- There are 4 buttons i.e, 4 functionalities:
   1. When **Display** button is clicked table will be generated.
    2. When **Create** button is clicked form will be displayed to give new entries to the table.
    3. When **Delete** button is clicked ID must be given to delete the row in table.
    4. When **Update** button is clicked we can get the ID already exists in the table and change the data of it.
